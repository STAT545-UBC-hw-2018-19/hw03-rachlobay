# hw03-rachlobay
This repo. is for HW #3 for STAT 545A at UBC.

# Objective 

This assignment is to use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data.

**The 3 tasks I chose to do are the following:**

1) Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

2) Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

3) Investigate how is life expectancy changing over time on different continents?
