# hw03-rachlobay
This repo. is for HW #3 for STAT 545A at UBC.

# Objective 

This assignment is to use dplyr/ggplot2 to manipulate and explore data.

**The 3 tasks I chose to do are the following:**

1) Get the maximum and minimum of GDP per capita for all continents.

2) Look at the spread of GDP per capita within the continents.

3) Compute a trimmed mean of life expectancy for different years. Or a weighted mean, weighting by population. Just try something other than the plain vanilla mean.
